## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I'm Leonardo Klaus, an Industrial Engineer on a transformative journey into the realm of programming. Though I initially ventured into a different career path, my love for coding persisted since I first learned PHP at the age of 13.  It was only 3 years ago, already working on my formation area that I decided to realign my professional trajectory and focus wholeheartedly on honing my IT skills.

## ðŸš€ My Journey 

My programming journey kicked off with Python, delving into the intricacies of data structures and algorithms. As my confidence grew, I shifted my focus to JavaScript and TypeScript, mastering the art of developing APIs with Node.js and Front-End using Angular and React.

Feeling the need to diversify my skill set, I embarked on a Java adventure. Learning Java not only sharpened my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills but also provided a solid foundation for understanding Design Patterns and principles. Building upon this knowledge, I delved into the Spring framework, refining my abilities to model and create robust Rest APIs while enhancing my proficiency in both SQL and NoSQL databases.

As a next challenge, I'm currently immersed in the world of Go. Eager to broaden my horizons, I am actively learning and exploring the intricacies of this programming universe.
